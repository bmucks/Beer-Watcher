# Beer-Watcher
Demo Point-of-sale system intended for bars. Includes a few features I always wanted to see from my POS systems when I bartend. The app includes a function and meter that estimates the amount of beer left in a keg, cocktail recipes in the menu screen to help newly hired staff and more. 
Takes an API from Brew Dog brewery and is imported among a hardcoded beer list. You can add and remove beers by selecting from the on deck menu to the right and selecting the corresponding tap in the field below. 

More work to be done with CSS layout, more taps to be added, and other smaller issues.
